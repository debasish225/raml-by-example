# `osprey-mock-service` v0.3.0 released ðŸš€

A new version of `osprey-mock-service` -- [v0.3.0](https://github.com/mulesoft-labs/osprey-mock-service/releases/tag/v0.3.0) -- has been released today. This is a summary of the new features and improvments included in this release.

## Returning different examples each time

When multiple examples are defined in a given RAML type, `osprey-mock-service` will now select one of them "randomly".

```raml
(...)

/users:
  get:
    responses:
      200:
        headers:
          foo:
            examples:
              first: one
              second: two
              third: three
              fourth: four
```

## Adding support for `{ext}` 

The `{ext}` URI parameter in RAML 1.0 -- fka `{mediaTypeExtension}` in RAML 0.8 -- provides a mechanism to define resources that have multiple media types defined. Given the following definition:

```raml
(...)

/file{ext}:
  get:
    responses:
      200:
        body:
          application/json:
            example:
            (...)
          application/xml:
            example:
            (...)

```

`/file.json` and `/file.xml` will return their respective content type's examples.
